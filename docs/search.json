They are now occasionally investigated by researchers interested in studying the co-existing of species in re-occurring assemblages. They are also used commonly in population biology, but many caveats exist with this."

One of the real first pieces of information to work towards figuring out is how much computer power you have, and that will inform the domain and grains. Generally who you are working with, or what experience with software you have wil determine the environments you are using. Acquiring species records, and the independent variables can take some review time, but both are now largely available at specialized databasea for them. The choices of modelling approaches to attempt again come largely down to personal experience and familiarity with a type of model or algorithms. Evaluation kind of comes down to where you would feel the least bad about being wrong; do you want to over or under predict? What are the consequences of preding a false presence?"

It is easy to get carried away when you do not have to collect field data yourself, and try to perform analyses at enormous spatial scales, or at very very fine details.\nRemember the ‘domain’ is the spatial extent over which we are interested in studying a process. Generally, these are defined by funding agencies, e.g. for all of my normal office work, I use extents of land ownership; a form of administrative boundary. For academic work, depending on how the funding comes through, we may be much more likely to use domains informed by ecological processes. Examples would be a floristic province, or an ecoregion concept.\nGrain is the resolution of an event in both time and space. For a spatial grain, you want to gather predictor variables which are able to correlate well with your species. For example day length in spring for plants, will only vary substantially over quite large scales. Elevation at a scale of 1 meter, rather than a more coarse surface would contain much meaningless variation. So we must balance these; however, most publicly available spatial data come only at a few resolutions (800m2, 1000m2, or 4000m2).\nTemporal grain is very important for migratory animals, it is also very important if you want to see a species distribution before climate change effects, and after, and if you want to project your results into the future under climate change projections.\nIt sounds like you will have many options to sort through here, but no! You are informed by computer power, you do what you can, just like with fieldwork."

Furthermore, open source alternatives are generally much better than paid software. As species distribution models are really all about the statistics, R, is an un- paralled software to generate SDM’s in, and will keep your notes for you! However, grass gis offers several modules, all of which are accessible from the command line, which create useful spatial data products. Likewise QGIS is a really great lightweight GIS with a super friendly graphical user interface which you can use to visualize your predictor variables more dynamically than the experience offered by R and Rstudio.\nWe rely heavily on the sdm package, which is one of the best examples of object orientated programming which I have seen in R, and is capable of loading in statistical methods from nearly any R package you want! For example if you want any flavor of linear models you can import new methods from any Ben Bolker package you want!"

Fortunately, what started to be developed when I came on the scene are what we call digital herbaria consortia, which collect records from all herbaria in a region in one place. What started to exist when you all came around were the ‘aggregators’ which aggregated the records from the consortia, and now citizen science records!

Usually, for these records you want to work with a Natural Heritage Program, or Natural History Survey; they tend to specialize in these surveys and maintenance of these records. One problem with old records, which is somewhat ameliorated for rare species, is the accuracy of the records geolocation. Old maps were not exceptional, and most botanists don’t press or note exactly where a specimen came from in the old days.\nFor more common species, you are able to now glean considerable amounts of information from citizen science resources; although these tend to be phenotypically biased towards pretty flowers, at the expense of truly gorgeous flowers such as those in groups like the Sedges."

In my experience I feel like 2/3 of people do not use them, and a 1/3 do. Basically, these will go into the model building processing as areas of habitat which are known to be unsuitable to the focal species; for whatever reason.\nIf you want to use these, you are able to get a large number of them from standardized vegetation protocols which contain species richness meaders across a specific area. As you are likely to try and acquire these data, as they are more regularly occurring, and capture enormous geographic and environmental diversity, you can throw them in and see what happens. Some rules of thumb exist for using them, but they don’t seem that wonderful. We cite a paper here which calls for 10k absence records, but this seems to swamp the link functions in most models (I.

They rely entirely on CORRELATION, even if you are using variables which you know have causal relationships with plant distributions the models that we are creating will not really reflect causal processes.

The first is across North America, we will probably have very good results using rather simple variables, at relatively coarse grains. For example, the maximum temperature - e.g. heat stress, and minimum temperatures are linked to the movement of moisture in plants and have enormous effects on distributions. Even the two sides of the Mississippi River Drainage basin, largely this an area so flat for nearly a thousand miles you cannot even detect changes in elevation or slope; might have the single largest effect on the flora of north america!\nWhen we move to less extensive domains our predictors will change. We may start to gather very good information from toporgraphic relief, especially in the west; soil now be at a scale where it correlates with distributions at the class level, and solar radiation may start to tease out mesic north facing forested areas.\nAs we move to fine domains, and these really are the frontier for these models, especially in academic settings, we are really starting to get to very directly related features. Here we can really start to integrate field experiments, and nitty gritty natural history observations with species distribution models. Assuming you can find the spatial data to do so!"

The simplest approach is just viewing the variance and seeing if you have anything low, for example that top-most bar.

We will only discuss three simple evaluation criteria. First off bear in mind, all we can evaluate of a model, is how well it performs on the splits in our data, these models are unable to be held to the same standard in the field that they perform at on a computer. SO\nAccuracy, is essentially very simple, how often are you correct? If we were to have 200 data points, and use 100 for training and 100 for testing, how often would our model be able to predict the presences of the withheld points? How accurate do we want to be? Better than 50%, right? That’s chance. Generally models with over 70% accuracy are considered useful. There are two major subsets of Accuracy, which oftentimes go by different names, but we will only refer to them as Sensitivity and Specificity here.\nSensitivity is how often we are able to identify a presence, if we had a model which identified every single presence in the test data it would have a sensitivity of 100%.\nSpecificity is how often we are able to identify an absence, if we had a model which identified every single absence in the test data it would have a specifity of 100%.\nSO… it is not hard to imagine, that a model may cheat, and become very well at finding presences; maybe by just classifying every cell as a presence!! So that is why it is good to consider both sensitivity and specificity together under the umbrella of accuracy.\nCan you think of any scenarios where we could want a model that is able to predict only suitable habitat really well? i.e. where we lean into sensitivity ?\nCan you think of any scenarios where we could want a model that is able to predict unsuitable habitat really well?

    "text": "modelling ensemble learning\n\nEnsemble learning utilizes many sets of trees, each tree being composed of many binary decisions, to create a single model. Each independent variable ( - or feature) may become a node on the tree - i.e. a location on the tree where a binary decision will move towards a predicted outcome. Each of the decision tree models which ensemble learning utilizes is a weak model, each of which may suffer due to high variance or bias, but which produce better outcomes than would be expected via chance. When ensembled these models generate a strong model, a model which should have more appropriately balanced variance and bias and predicts outcomes which are more strongly correlated with the expected values than the individual weak models."

A large number of trees are then aggregated, via the most common predictions, to generate a final classification prediction tree. Each individual prediction tree is generated independently of the others."

All response data and predictor variables are kept available to all trees."
