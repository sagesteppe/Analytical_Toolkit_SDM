This repository contains the graphics, code, URL links, and r script which were used to generate the guest lecture for the PBC 470 course 'Analytical Toolkit for Evolutionary Biologists and Ecologists'. 

It contains four main directories, two Rscripts, and one Rmarkdown file document. If you would like to types notes directly onto the presentation, you have three main options. 
1) **Clone the repository** using github, easy, but if you have not done it before do not try during class.  

2) **Download all files manually**, go the green button '**<> Code**',  and select "**Download ZIP**", this file should download to your downloads directory (~ 'folder'), copy it from there to your course directory.  

3) **Copy and paste the Rmarkdown script** click the **folders** section , and then **presentation.rmd**, from here click the little button **Raw** to the upper right of the code. You should now see a very simple webpage, which looks like a simple text file (like notepad!). Copy and paste this *(Using your keyboard hold down **Ctrl** + **a**, and then **Ctrl** + **c**)*, now open Rstudio! In Rstudio, at the upper left of the window, go to **File** -> **New File** -> **Rmarkdown**, from this pop-up box select **Presentation**, and leave the default format as **HTML (ioslides)**. Now you should have a new R file in front of you, on your keyboard **Cntr** + **a**, and then **backspace**, now just paste *(**control** + **v** the contents in)*. You will have to save this file at some point now, **ctrl** + **s** will open a prompt for that. 

Note that only options 1 & 2 will allow you to 're-create' the slide show. If you use option 3, you can knit this to PDF in a round about way to print note, but you will need to remove the paths to images, each of which is preceded by '!'
